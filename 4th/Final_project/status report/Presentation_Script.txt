Slide 2: Problem Description
- Introduction to the Problem:
  - "The development of efficient models for terahertz, or THz, transmission lines is one of the critical challenges in modern telecommunications."
  - "THz frequencies, ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz, offer exceptional bandwidth, enabling technologies like high-speed wireless communication, biomedical imaging, and advanced sensing. However, their unique electromagnetic properties—such as high attenuation, dispersion, and non-linearities—make modeling a challenge."
- Why It Matters:
  - "Traditional methods, like the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach, require significant computational resources and may lack precision. Other alternatives, such as numerical inverse Laplace transform (NILT) and RLC ladder approximations, also have limitations like sensitivity to input parameters and stability issues."
  - "Therefore, an accurate and computationally efficient solution is necessary to address these challenges."

Slide 3: Proposed Solution
- Objective:
  - "The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate numerical models for THz transmission lines that are suitable for time-domain simulations."
- Methods:
  - "We propose a step-by-step approach, combining three methods:"
    - "First, the FDTD method provides an initial time-domain approximation. This method divides the transmission line into spatial and temporal grids, which enables us to model electromagnetic wave behavior."
    - "Next, the RLC ladder model represents the transmission line with lumped elements, improving computational efficiency by discretizing the system into smaller segments."
    - "Finally, NILT allows us to transform exact s-domain solutions into the time domain, ensuring accuracy and validating results."
- Visual Aid:
  - "Here you can see a schematic of the staggered grid used in the FDTD method and an example of the voltage simulation output."

Slide 4: Work Progress
- Progress Made:
  - "So far, I have completed the following tasks:"
    - "Implemented the FDTD method in MATLAB for a lossless transmission line, successfully simulating transient and steady-state behaviors."
    - "Simulated the RLC ladder network and compared results with exact solutions. This included analyzing the impact of increasing the number of sections on accuracy."
    - "Validated these results using NILT, which transformed s-domain solutions into the time domain."
- Results:
  - "The simulations demonstrate promising accuracy for both FDTD and RLC ladder models. However, the challenge remains in optimizing the number of sections to balance computational efficiency and accuracy."
- Visual Aid:
  - "Here, the voltage-time graphs show how these methods perform under different conditions."

Slide 5: Project Plan for Semester 2
- Overview of the Plan:
  - "To complete the project, I have outlined a detailed plan with key milestones for Semester 2."
  - "In Weeks 1 to 3, I will refine and validate existing models, identifying gaps or inconsistencies."
  - "In Weeks 4 to 7, I will derive and test time-domain representations of the RLC ladder models across various THz frequencies."
  - "During Weeks 8 to 10, I will conduct PSPICE simulations and finalize the report."
- Visual Aid:
  - "This Gantt chart summarizes the timeline for these activities, tasks, and deliverables."

Slide 6: Key Challenges and Mitigation
- Challenges:
  - "A major challenge is ensuring numerical stability when using NILT, as inaccuracies can propagate across frequency ranges."
  - "Another challenge is optimizing the number of sections in the RLC ladder models while maintaining computational efficiency."
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - "To address these, I plan to perform iterative testing and error analysis. This will allow me to fine-tune the models and achieve the desired level of accuracy."
- Visual Aid:
  - "This graph shows a comparison between the exact solution and the RLC ladder model for varying numbers of sections, illustrating how accuracy improves with segmentation."

Slide 7: Conclusion and Future Plans
- Summary:
  - "In summary, this project aims to develop efficient numerical models for THz transmission lines by combining FDTD, RLC ladder approximations, and NILT methods."
  - "The work completed so far shows promising results, and the outlined plan ensures that the remaining challenges will be systematically addressed."
- Future Plans:
  - "Beyond this project, these models can be extended to simulate complex THz systems, such as multi-conductor lines, and applied in real-world scenarios like 6G networks and biomedical imaging."
- Closing:
  - "Thank you for your attention. I would be happy to answer any questions."
