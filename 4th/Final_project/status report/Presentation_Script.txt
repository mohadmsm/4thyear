"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. My name is Mohammed Al Shuaili, and today I will present my final year project, Simulation and Exploration of THz Transmission Lines. My supervisor for this work is Dr. Marissa Condon."
"I will cover the problem, proposed solutions, work progress, key challenges, and future plans."

Slide 1: Problem Description
"The development of efficient models for terahertz (THz) transmission lines is a critical challenge. THz frequencies, ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz, provide exceptional bandwidth for applications like high-speed communication and biomedical imaging."
"However, their unique electromagnetic characteristics—high attenuation, significant dispersion, and nonlinearities—make modeling difficult."
"Traditional methods like FDTD are computationally expensive, while alternatives like NILT and RLC ladder models face accuracy and stability issues."

Slide 2: Proposed Solutions

"Our goal is to develop accurate, efficient numerical models for THz transmission lines."
"We use three methods:"
"FDTD for an initial time-domain approximation."
"RLC ladder models to discretize the system for computational efficiency."
"NILT to validate results by transforming s-domain solutions into the time domain."
"Here, Figure 1 shows the FDTD staggered grid method, Figure 2 illustrates the RLC ladder approximation, and Figure 3 depicts the exact solution in the s-domain."

Slide 3: Work Progress
"So far, I have implemented FDTD in MATLAB, simulating transient and steady-state behaviors of a lossless line."
"I modeled the transmission line using RLC ladder networks and validated the results by comparing them with exact solutions. Figure 4 shows a comparison of FDTD, RLC, and exact results."
"NILT was used to transform and validate time-domain results derived from the s-domain."
"Overall, promising accuracy has been achieved, but further optimization is needed."

Slide 4: Key Challenges and Mitigation
"A major challenge is deriving a time-domain model that captures both transient and steady-state behaviors while maintaining computational efficiency."
"Another challenge is validating the model across wide frequency ranges to ensure accuracy and reliability."
"To address this, I will integrate Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) into the RLC model's s-domain representation with varying section counts and perform iterative testing and error analysis."

Slide 5: Project Plan for Semester 2
"The upcoming plan involves key milestones:"
"In Weeks 1 to 3, I will refine the models and validate initial results."
"In Weeks 4 to 7, I will derive and test time-domain representations across different THz frequencies."
"During Weeks 8 to 10, I will conduct PSPICE simulations and finalize the report."
"This Gantt chart highlights the activities and deliverables."

Slide 6: Conclusion and Future Plans

"In conclusion, this project aims to develop efficient numerical models for THz transmission lines, combining FDTD, RLC ladder, and NILT methods."
"The work completed so far demonstrates promising results, and with continued optimization, these models can be extended for practical applications like 6G networks and biomedical imaging."
"Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions."
